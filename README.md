A Reinforcement Learning model of muliple agents simulated in PettingZoo

We are building off of the Simple Spread environment in the pettingzoo library.

# Getting Started as a Contributor
Be sure that your version of Python is between 3.8 and 3.11. 3.12 is not supported yet. To get started, clone this git repository. Within it, create a virtual environment. Once you're running the virtual environment, install the dependencies found in requirements.txt. For example, if using venv from the mac terminal,
```console
> cd RL-MultiAgent-PettingZoo # change directory to the repo
> python -m venv venv # create a virtual environment (venv) in a folder called venv.
> source venv/bin/activate # activate virtual environment
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt # install dependencies listed in requirements.txt
```

Run RL_forage.py to test out code
